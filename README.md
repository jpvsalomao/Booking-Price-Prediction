# Project-Price-Prediction
Used Python to collect data from Booking.com and predict the charged price based on room and location based information.

Objective: 
While society is slowly recovering from the pandemic, travel demand is on the rise. As a result, related industries, particularly the hospitality industry, should devise effective business strategies to differentiate themselves in order to increase the competitive advantage and attract more customers. 
The business scenario considered in this report; A new hotel is entering the market of California and they are interested in understanding the factors that influence hotel pricing, especially by the online aggregators since they seem to attract millions of customers. 

Data Description: 
Our dataset was built using a combination of Booking.com, Google Maps API, and City API (by API Ninjas) to extract location-based information from hotels located in California. One constraint that we found was that Booking only shows the first 1000 results, limiting the number of records in our dataset.
The final data set contained the following features: Hotel Name, city, room type, breakfast, cancellation, review, star rating, price per day, preferred partner property, city population,	latitude, longitude, and attractions (90 extra columns containing information about places around the location within 2 miles of radius).
